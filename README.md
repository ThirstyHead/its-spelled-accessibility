PRESENTATION: It's Spelled 'Accessibility', not 'Disability'

Ten years ago -- in the pre-iPhone days -- many companies questioned the need for a mobile-friendly website. Last year, mobile internet traffic surpassed desktop traffic, and many of those same companies are still struggling to catch up.

What does this have to do with Accessibility (or "a11y" for short)? The World Wide Web Consortium says, "Accessibility overlaps with other best practices such as mobile web design, device independence, multi-modal interaction, usability, design for older users, and search engine optimization (SEO)."

Currently, having a disability means that you are a part of the world's largest minority group -- 650 million people across the globe, and nearly 20% of the US population. If you live in a country with a life expectancy over 70 years, studies show you will spend roughly 8 years or almost 12% of your life with a disability.

What if you could increase your website's SEO, improve your mobile web design, and get a head start on the coming Conversational UI revolution ("Hello Alexa, Siri, Google, and Cortana") through a renewed focus on Accessibility? And what if, while you did it, you increased your user base by potentially 10-20% by making it more accessible to disabled users?

Come hear Scott Davis (Principal Engineer with ThoughtWorks) explain how Accessibility in 2017 should be just as important to you as a mobile design strategy was ten years ago.
