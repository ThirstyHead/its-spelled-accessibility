      If you haven’t read the HTML5 language spec, here’s the first paragraph. Let me read it for you.
            </p>
            <p>
“HTML is the World Wide Web’s core markup language.” Yes! And it has been for over 30 years. Isn’t that remarkable? 
            </p>
            <p>
“Originally, HTML was primarily designed as a language for semantically describing scientific documents.” This is true as well. Tim Berners-Lee was working at CERN at the time he created the Web. CERN is, of course, the home of the Large Hadron Collider, among other scientific projects. 
            </p>
            <p>
But “semantics”, huh? What does that word mean with regards to web development?
