      I’m sure that none of you here are [div]-driven developers -- developers who use the [div] and [span] elements as their elements of choice. But maybe you work with one or two on your team. 

            </p>
            <p>
That’s an interesting, if flawed, approach to web development, because [div]s and [span]s literally mean nothing. They “do not inherently represent anything”. They are semantically void, and “should be used only when no other semantic element is appropriate.”

            </p>
            <p>
[div]s and [span]s are the empty calories of web development. They are nutritionally void. They are the potato chips (or crisps) of web development, and as the WebAIM report shows, we are dying of malnutrition.
