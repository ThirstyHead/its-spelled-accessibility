      Here's a great example of what Kat is talking about. When I look at this entrance to a building on the campus of University of Colorado at Boulder (just up the road from my house), I don't feel excluded at all. I can walk up those three short steps without any problems. I don't need a handrail to help me up. I can fit through those narrow doors without an issue. Heck, I don’t even need a button to automatically open those doors for me.

But do you notice that tiny blue sign in the lower right hand corner of the image? That’s the real life equivalent of “This website best viewed in Internet Explorer.” That sign says, “The accessible entrance you’re looking for isn’t here. It’s over there -- around the corner.” That’s exclusion in action, right there.
