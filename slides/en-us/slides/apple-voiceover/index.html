      I like reaching for my smartphone when it comes to testing accessibility. Not only is it easier to use, we're actually living in a mobile-majority world right now when it comes to web usage. Using a smartphone simply better represents what your users are actually going to use when they visit your website.
            </p>
            <p>
More than half of the world uses their smartphone for web access right now, and have been since 2017. In the next couple of years, over 75% of the world will use their smartphones for web access. And these folks are actually smartphone-only. In the US today, the number of smartphone-only users is over 20%, or 1 out of 5 people. 
            </p>
            <p>
So using smartphones to test accessibility just makes sense because you're actually using the device that your users will most likely using as well.
