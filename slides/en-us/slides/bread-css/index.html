        <h2 aria-hidden="false">Styling vs Semantics</h2>
        <figure>
          <p>If I use CSS and a &lt;style&gt; element to make our &lt;h2&gt; elements appear larger than our &lt;h1&gt;, does it change the <span class="highlight">semantics</span> as well?</p>
          <figcaption>
            <p>
      I mention this only because when I was taught HTML, my teacher focused on the look and feel (or styling) of the elements rather than the semantics. 
            </p>
            <p>
An [h1] is bigger than an [h2]. An [h2] is bigger than an [h3]. 
            </p>
            <p>
But we just learned, starting with the very first paragraph of the HTML5 language spec, that HTML is for defining semantics, not look and feel. For styling, we have this thing called CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets. (It’s right there in the name, isn’t it?)
            </p>
            <p>
So, if we use CSS to make [h2] elements larger than [h1] elements, do you think that it changes the semantics of the elements as well?
