      So, here’s how VoiceOver sounds on my iPhone when I enable it and “triple-click and twist” -- triple click on the side button, and then twist the middle of the screen. (The steps you take on an Android phone may be different, but the results should be basically the same.)

Oh, is this hard to follow? You’re missing one of your senses, aren’t you? You can’t see what’s going on.

Let me turn on closed captioning, and see if that helps. [turn on captions, play again in full]
