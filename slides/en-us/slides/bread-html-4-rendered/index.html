      And here’s what that same web page looks like when it’s rendered in a web browser.

Notice the “meaning” or “semantics” behind the Ingredients. Does it matter what order you pull the ingredients out of your cupboard? Can you grab the yeast before you grab the flour? Of course you can! It’s an “Unordered List”.
            </p>
            <p>
But, how about the Instructions? Is that an Ordered List or an Unordered List? What happens if you preheat the oven to 450 F degrees (step 3) before you mix the ingredients and leave them to sit out on your counter overnight (steps 1 and 2)? You probably get yelled at by your spouse when the utility bill arrives at the end of the month, if your house doesn’t burn down first. 
            </p>
            <p>
So you can see that HTML is all about semantics.
