       Sadly, they are not. 
            </p>
            <p>
98% of all home pages tested had errors, and they were really boring, common, not-rare-at-all accessibility errors. 

            </p>
            <p>
Over 80% of the pages had poor color contrast -- something that is easily detectable and easily fixable since nearly every tool will give you the proper color contrast when it detects an error. This is not complicated. 

            </p>
            <p>
Over 2/3s of home pages featured images without alt text. After 30 years, who doesn’t know that they need to provide alt text with the [img] tag?

            </p>
            <p>
Over half of the homepages tested had empty links, or malformed HTML forms with [input] elements that didn’t have a semantically associated [label] element.
