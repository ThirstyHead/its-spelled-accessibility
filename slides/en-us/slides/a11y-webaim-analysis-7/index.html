      Because when the WebAIM analysis came across a [div] or a [span] they ignored it because they had to.

            </p>
            <p>
[div]s and [span]s have no built-in accessibility functionality, because they have no semantics. They mean nothing.

            </p>
            <p>
So, as bad as this report is, do you think including [div]s and [span]s would make the numbers better, or worse?
