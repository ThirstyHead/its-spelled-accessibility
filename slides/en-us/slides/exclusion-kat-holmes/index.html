      The reason I like using the phrase Universal Design instead of Inclusive Design is because, by definition, it's hard to know when you're not being included. On the other hand, it's really easy to figure out when you're being excluded.

Kat Holmes, who's the author of the fantastic book Mismatch: How Inclusion Shapes Design, says, “Ask a hundred people what inclusion means, and you’ll get a hundred different answers. Ask them what it means to be excluded, and the answer will be uniformly clear: it's when you’re left out.”
