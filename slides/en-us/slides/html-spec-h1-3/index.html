      Here’s one way to test it. Let’s take the visual aspect of the web page (the look and feel) completely out of the equation and listen to the semantics of the elements instead. 
            </p>
            <p>
To do this, we can take advantage of the “assistive technology” baked into every desktop computer, every laptop, and every tablet or smartphone, regardless of the operating system. Windows, MacOS, Linux, iOS, or Android -- every operating system today as a “screen reader” baked right into it.
            </p>
            <p>
All we have to do is enable it and have it read our semantics back to us.
