      Here’s the entrance to my neighborhood grocery store -- it’s a hole in the wall. I’m not talking about the store itself -- it’s actually quite clean and modern inside. I mean the actual entrance to the building -- it’s literally a hole in the wall.

It’s an entrance that’s wide enough for shoppers pushing grocery carts. It’s wide enough for parents pushing strollers. It’s wide enough for workers pushing heavy carts. And, yes, it’s wide enough for folks in wheelchairs and walkers to easily use as well.

The buildings that grocery stores are in tend to be great examples of Universal Design in action -- wide aisles, well-lit, easy to get around and find things.
