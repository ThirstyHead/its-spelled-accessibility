       Now, don't get me wrong. I don't want us to ignore the disability aspect of accessibility. I don’t want you to ignore your empathy; your core humanity. As a matter of fact, I’m hoping that after this talk, you’ll spend more time thinking about those things. But when we frame the conversation of accessibility around disability, it opens the door for all kinds of excuses.

I mean, why even bother with accessibility? I don't know anyone who has a disability, do you? I don’t think that any of my co-workers have a disability. I’m not even sure that our customers have disabilities. So, how expensive will it be to make our website fully accessible? How far behind will it put us on our scheduled path to production? And what about the expertise? I don’t work with anyone who specializes in accessibility. Do you?
