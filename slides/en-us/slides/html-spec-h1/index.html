      If you refer back to the HTML5 language spec, it tells you that each [h] element represents the heading of a section. 
            </p>
            <p>
Now, I don’t normally add the [section] element when I’m using an [h] element. Do you? But, even if you and I don’t, an implicit [section] is created. 
            </p>
            <p>
In the case of our recipe, we end up with [sections] for Ingredients and Instructions just by using the [h2] elements.
