      Which is why it's so ironic that the websites of grocery stores across the United States tend to be frequent targets of ADA-based web accessibility lawsuits.

One of the first wins for ADA advocates was against the Winn-Dixie chain of grocery stores. The judge ruled that the “Title III” section of the ADA covering “places of public accommodations (businesses that are generally open to the public, such as restaurants, movie theaters, schools, day care facilities, recreation facilities, and doctors' offices)” also covers those businesses’ websites. This is called the “Nexus” rule -- the website is an extension of the physical business, and therefore is covered by the same ADA rules.
