      Does this picture help? It's curb cuts -- those dips that bring the sidewalk down to street level. Curb Cuts are a great example of Universal Design. Disability doesnâ€™t even enter into this particular discussion, does it? This is just a mother out for a walk with her child in a stroller, taking full advantage of the curb cuts in her neighborhood.
