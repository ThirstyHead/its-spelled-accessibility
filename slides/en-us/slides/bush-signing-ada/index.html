      You see, the Americans with Disability Act (ADA) was passed in 1990 -- right around the time that the Web was first being introduced as well. The ADA made curb cuts mandatory in cities across the United States. Now theyâ€™ve become so ubiquitous that they just kind of fade into the background.  We don't pay any attention to them, but they are everywhere.
