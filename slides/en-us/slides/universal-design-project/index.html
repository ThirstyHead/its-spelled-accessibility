      So, instead of talking about accessibility in terms of disability, I like framing the conversation around the idea of Universal Design. This is a concept -- like so many concepts in software development -- that we've borrowed from building architects and civil engineering. Universal Design is designing for not just some of the people, or even most of the people -- we design for all of the people.

The success of our architecture is how usable it is by everyone who is trying to use it.
