      And once your browser can see your face, hands, and arms, you can begin speaking ASL (American Sign Language) to your computer. 
            </p>
            <p>
In this example, Abhishek uses ASL to speak to his computer. Those words, in turn, are converted to speech. That speech, in turn, is used to talk to Alexa on his Amazon Echo smart speaker. 
            </p>
            <p>
Alexaâ€™s response is run through a speech-to-text converter, and the resulting text is displayed on the screen. 
            </p>
            <p>
All using free, open source software and inexpensive, consumer-grade commodity hardware.
