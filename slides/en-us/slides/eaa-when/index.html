     While the EAA was adopted in 2016, it was “transposed into national law” in September of 2018. Websites created after 2018 were required to be accessible by September, 2019. And all existing websites must be accessible by September, 2020. Mobile apps have until June of 2021 to become compliant with the accessibility requirements of the EAA.

This new law will improve the digital lives of over 80 million European citizens who are currently living with a disability.
