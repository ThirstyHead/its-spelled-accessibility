      I know it can be trite to start off with a dictionary definition, but when I read this one about accessibility, it really appealed to me. This feels like a great description of our job as web developers. "Accessibility is being able to be reached or found. Accessibility is being easy to use. Accessibility is being easily understood or appreciated." Don't these sound like the goals of being a web developer?
