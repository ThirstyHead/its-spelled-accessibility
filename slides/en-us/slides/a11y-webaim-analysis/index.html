      So, how well do you think weâ€™re supporting such a large and powerful market demographic as web developers? 
            </p>
            <p>
Well, you remember how much I like to use numbers to guide my decisions.

The WebAIM organization (Web Accessibility in Mind) is a US-based not-for-profit that has been doing digital accessibility work since 1999. 
            </p>
            <p>
They have a great, free web accessibility audit tool called WAVE. So they took their accessibility tool and used it to evaluate the top 1 million websites. Do you want to make a guess as to how many a11y errors they uncovered?
