      Here’s an example of Universal Design and inclusivity in action -- another building on the same University of Colorado campus. 
            </p>
            <p>
Notice that there are no stairs to climb, so there's no need for a handrail, either. These doors are considerably wider than those on the previous building. And we have a button to automatically open the doors for us. 
            </p>
            <p>
You’ve probably walked through ADA-compliant entrances to buildings hundreds, if not thousands of times without even thinking about it. 
            </p>
            <p>
While this is good, we can do even better on the design of this building’s entrance.
