      Can you see why curb cuts are so simple, and so valuable at the same time?

As a matter of fact, curb cuts have been around for so long that they’re the source of a number of great academic studies. And this is what I think is most interesting about these studies -- they say, “When the wall of exclusion came down, everybody benefited. Not only people in wheelchairs. Parents pushing strollers. Workers pushing heavy carts. Business Travelers with wheeled suitcases. A study of pedestrian behavior found that nine out of 10 ‘unencumbered pedestrians’ go out of their way to use a curb cut.”
