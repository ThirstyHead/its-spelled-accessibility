      <h1>It's Spelled 'Accessibility', not 'Disability'</h1>

    <p>If your mobile phone is in silent/vibrate mode right now, would you say that you're using an accessibility feature, or just a feature of your phone? If you've ever adjusted the size of onscreen content by pinching or stretching, do you feel like you have a disability, or are you simply using your phone as it was meant to be used?</p>

    <p>In this keynote, Scott Davis (Principal Engineer and Web Architect, ThoughtWorks) discusses Universal Design, in which we design features for everyone to use, not just an arbitrary subset of our users.</p>

    <p>Granted, over 1 billion people across the world have some form of disability -- that's between 15% and 20% of the planet. And the top 1 million websites average over 60 accessibility errors per page -- that's one error for every 13 elements on the page. So yes, we as an industry have quite a bit of work to do to support the 20% of our users that need our accessibility efforts the most. But if you have plans to add a Conversational UI (like Siri, Alexa, or Cortana) to your product, is your plan to limit that interface to only your blind and low-vision users, or is it something that you hope all of your users will enjoy?</p>
